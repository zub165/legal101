  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: April 10, 2025</p>

  <p>Welcome to our application. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app ("Legal101", "we", "our", or "us").</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We do not collect personal data unless explicitly provided by the user (e.g., when submitting a support request or signing in). Our app may collect anonymized usage statistics to improve performance and usability.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use non-personal data (such as device type, interaction frequency) solely to understand how users interact with the app and to improve the app experience. If you provide your email for support, we only use it to contact you regarding your request.</p>

  <h2>3. Sharing of Information</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent user information to third parties. We may share anonymized data with analytics services to improve app functionality.</p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Our app may integrate with third-party services like OpenAI or PayPal. These services are governed by their own privacy policies. We recommend reviewing them separately:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://openai.com/privacy" target="_blank">OpenAI Privacy Policy</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full" target="_blank">PayPal Privacy Policy</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>
  <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data. However, no transmission method is 100% secure. Please contact us immediately if you believe your data has been compromised.</p>

  <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13. If we discover such data has been collected, it will be deleted promptly.</p>

  <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your data by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@example.com">support@example.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date.</p>
