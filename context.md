## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Interactions

**Q: Do I have to answer questions from police officers?**
A: No, you have the right to remain silent. You can politely state: "I am exercising my right to remain silent and wish to speak with an attorney."

**Q: Can I record my interaction with police officers?**
A: In most states, you have the right to record police in public. However, state laws vary, and you should not interfere with police duties while recording.

**Q: Do I have to show ID to a police officer?**
A: This varies by state. In "Stop and Identify" states, you may be required to identify yourself if an officer has reasonable suspicion you're involved in criminal activity. Otherwise, you generally don't have to provide ID.

### Traffic Stops

**Q: What should I do during a traffic stop?**
A: Stay calm, keep hands visible, turn on interior light if at night, inform the officer before reaching for documents, and provide license/registration if requested.

**Q: Can an officer search my car during a traffic stop?**
A: Officers need either a warrant, your consent, probable cause, or reasonable belief evidence of a crime will be found. You can clearly state: "I do not consent to a search of my vehicle."

### Home Encounters

**Q: Do I have to let police into my home?**
A: No, unless they have a valid search warrant, there are emergency circumstances, or they have probable cause. You can speak through the door and ask to see a warrant.

**Q: What should I do if police have a search warrant for my home?**
A: Ask to see the warrant, verify details (address, judge's signature), state that you do not consent to the search (but do not physically resist), and observe the search if possible.

## Application Workflow

The application operates as a single-page web application with different content sections shown/hidden based on user navigation:

1.  **Initial Load**: Displays the Home content (Hero section with search, Common Situations cards, Emergency banner).
2.  **Tab Navigation**: Clicking navigation links (Home, Travel Rights, Driving Rights, Police Interactions, Privacy Rights, Resources, AI FAQ, Settings) hides all sections and shows only the section corresponding to the clicked link. The URL hash is updated (e.g., `#travel`). Browser back/forward buttons work with this navigation.
3.  **Home Page Search**: Entering text in the search bar and clicking 'Search' (or pressing Enter) filters the *currently loaded content* across all sections (except Settings). Sections without the search term are hidden, and the term is highlighted in visible sections.
4.  **AI FAQ**: Allows users to ask questions. A simulated AI provides pre-defined answers based on keywords. It also includes 'Emergency Resources' buttons.
5.  **Emergency Resources**: Clicking buttons like 'Legal Hotline' or 'Legal Aid' displays a panel within the AI FAQ section containing relevant informational text and links.
6.  **Settings**: Provides options to change Theme (Light/Dark/Contrast), Language, and configure simulated API/other settings. Preferences are saved in localStorage.
